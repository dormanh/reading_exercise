# reading_exercise

A simple application I put together for my post-stroke aphasic father to help him practice sentences that might be useful in his everyday life. Refer to this [documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) for deployment on Heroku.

(The sentences and sentence categories are in Hungarian, so don't expect to understand them if you don't speak the language.)

Also, he loves wombats.
